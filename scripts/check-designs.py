"""The style-guide checks from ~/git/personal/STYLE-GUIDE.md §12, over a design surface.

    python3 scripts/check-designs.py .context/designs/mobile

There is no lint and no build for a design set, so these are it:

  inventory      every file on disk is declared in routes.js, and vice versa
  well-formed    every <div> is closed exactly once, in order
  links          every local href points at a file that exists
  tokens         every var(--x) and every colour class resolves against
                 shared.css + tailwind.config.js
  click-through  every declared edge is a real link in the screen it leaves
  flow-complete  every link between screens is a declared edge
  acyclic        the forward graph ranks by depth, so it must be a DAG
  routes         every app screen is drawn, and every drawing has an app screen
  app-flow       the app and the chart navigate alike, in both directions
  copy           every word a dialog or a toast puts on screen is drawn somewhere

The last two are a pair and the set needs both. Without the first the chart is
a diagram of an intention; without the second it quietly under-reports the
product. Exits non-zero on any failure.
