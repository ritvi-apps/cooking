/* Dev chrome for the wireframes — everything around the screen, and nothing in
 * it. Identical in every product, so learning one set teaches you all of them.
 * ============================================================================
 * A screen declares one thing:
 *
 *     <body data-chrome data-file="game/board.html">
 *
 * Everything else — siblings, states, prev/next, notes — comes from routes.js.
 * Depth is derived from data-file, so no screen knows or cares how deep it sits.
 *
 * This file owns TWO things:
 *
 *   1. window.WF — the derived model of the set: the flat route list, the
 *      state-to-screen collapse, the journey rank, and the main path. Every
 *      page loads _chrome.js, so this is the one place that derivation can
 *      live. It used to live in three: _chrome.js flattened the flows for
 *      back/next, _gallery.js rebuilt the same maps to draw the chart, and
 *      screenshots.html flattened them a third time for the contact sheet —
 *      and the three disagreed about what a state was.
 *   2. The bar itself.
 *
 * One bar, the same on every page — a screen, the flow chart, the screenshots.
 * Left to right, and this order does not vary:
 *
 *   LEFT    ⌘ all routes · ▦ screenshots · ‹ back · › next
 *   MIDDLE  every screen in this flow, then this screen's states
 *   RIGHT   ☀/☾ · ▭/▢ · ⓘ notes
 *
 * Navigation on the left and settings on the right, so the two never trade
 * places between a screen and the chart and you stop hunting for the control
 * you just used.
 *
 * The controls that mean the same thing on every page are ICONS, not words.
 * They are lucide — the same set the screens and the Expo app already use, so
 * nothing here is a second icon library and no SVG is hand-copied into this
 * file. A word is kept only where the word IS the content: the screen names in
 * the middle, and the state names beside them.
 *
 * The breadcrumb is gone. `mobile · /game ›` repeated the surface toggle on the
 * right and the flow tint in the chart, and it sat between the nav chips and
 * the screen chips pushing them apart for no information.
 *
 * The frame CLAMPS to what is left under the bar; it is never scaled. 390x844
 * is the logical size, and a fixed 844px frame plus a bar is taller than a
 * laptop viewport — but `transform: scale()` does not change layout height, so
 * the page still scrolled 844px to reveal a frame already drawn smaller. The
 * height is capped in shared.css instead, and all this publishes is how much
 * room the bar took.                                                          */
